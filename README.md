# weather-prediction-model-for-rainfall


To Download the Dataset you can download from kaggel Link for the dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package


This project is based on binary classification so i used different types of binary based alogorithm like ensemble techniques in which Random Forest,AdaBoost,Gradient Boost,Xgboost classifiers and from linear_model i used Logistic Regression and also naive bayes,svm for this project to check which algorithms is performing best.From the reslt we saw Xgboost and RandomForest performed very well in comparision to others so from these i got almost 85% of accuracy to increse this  accuracy we can use HyperParameter Optimization techinique like Randomizedsearccv and after appling we can using parameter of randomizedserch om gridsearchcv using algorithm as a randomforest to get more accuracy then 85%.
